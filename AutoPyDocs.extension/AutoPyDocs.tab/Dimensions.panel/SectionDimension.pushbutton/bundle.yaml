    How-To Guide:


    1. Click the "Rooms" button. You will be prompted to select where your rooms are: in current model or in linked model.
    
    2. You will need to select the type of width to dimension & then you will be prompted to choose the View Type, which filters corresponding views on the sheet.

    3. Select all rooms by clicking "Check All" or select the particular rooms that need dimensioning.

    Note: Only views already placed on sheets are included in the selection. Views not on sheets are excluded.

    Delete existing room dimensions for the selected views to avoid duplication.
