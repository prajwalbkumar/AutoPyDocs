    Tool Description:


    This tool streamlines levels alignment, flips levels tags to the standard side, and automatically generates linear dimensions for levels within selected views.

    ________________________________________________________________
        
    How-To Guide:


    1. Click the "Levels" button. You will be prompted to choose the View Type, which filters corresponding views on the sheet.

    2. Choose the relevant views from the list of views displayed on the sheet for the specified view type.

    3. If the levels are already aligned, selece 'No, only dimesnion levels', or otherwise.


    Note: Only views already placed on sheets are included in the selection. Views not on sheets are excluded.

    Delete existing levels dimensions for the selected views to avoid duplication.
