    Tool Description:


    This tool streamlines grid alignment, flips grid bubbles to the standard side, and automatically generates linear dimensions for grids within selected views.

    How-To Guide:


    1. Click the "Grids" button. You will be prompted to choose the View Type, which filters corresponding views on the sheet.

    2. Choose the relevant views from the list of views displayed on the sheet for the specified view type.


    Note: Only views already placed on sheets are included in the selection. Views not on sheets are excluded.

    Delete existing grid dimensions for the selected views to avoid duplication.
