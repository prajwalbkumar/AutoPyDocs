    Tool Description:


    This tool will automatically generate dimensions for linear walls within selected views.

    For exterior walls the tool will dimension both external and internal side of the wall.

    For interior walls the tool will dimension only the internal side of the wall.

    How-To Guide:


    1. Click the "Walls" button. You will be prompted to choose the View Type, which filters corresponding views on the sheet.

    2. Choose the relevant views from the list of views displayed on the sheet for the specified view type & click on "Select".

    3. Choose the wall types to be dimensioned.


    Note: Only views already placed on sheets are included in the selection. Views not on sheets are excluded.

    All the external walls should have Ext in the wall name and the external side of the wall should be in the exterior side of the buidling.

    All the interior walls shoul not have Ext in its name.

    Delete existing dimensions for the selected views to avoid duplication.
