    How-To Guide:


    1. Click the "Walls" button. You will be prompted to choose the View Type, which filters corresponding views on the sheet.

    2. Choose the relevant views from the list of views displayed on the sheet for the specified view type & click on "Select".

    3. Choose the wall types to be dimensioned.


    Note: Only views already placed on sheets are included in the selection. Views not on sheets are excluded.

    Delete existing dimensions for the selected views to avoid duplication.
