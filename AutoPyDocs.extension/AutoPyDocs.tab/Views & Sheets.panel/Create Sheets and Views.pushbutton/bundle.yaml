    Description:


    
    This tool allows you to automate the creation of view templates and associated views in Revit based on data from an Excel file. 
    It guides the user through selecting a discipline, title block family, and type, followed by processing Excel data to match view templates and levels. 
    The tool creates missing view templates, suggests custom templates when necessary, and generates floor plan views on corresponding levels, places elevation and section on sheets.

    How-To:

      1. Select Discipline: Choose the relevant discipline for the sheets, like "Architecture" or "Interiors."

      2. Select Title Block: Choose the family and type of title block to apply to each sheet.

      3. Upload Excel File: Select an Excel file that contains sheet data. Columns should match the script's requirements for parameters like scale and template type.

      4. Process Data: The script will read and process data from the Excel file, updating or creating templates as needed.

      5. Create Sheets: Sheets with the specified title blocks are created based on the processed data.



    Note: Ensure the Excel data is formatted correctly to avoid errors.
